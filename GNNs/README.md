# GNNs

### Tasks on Networks

- **Node classification:** Predict a type of a given node;
- **Link prediction:** Predict whether two nodes are linked;
- **Community detection:** Identify densely linked clusters of nodes;
- **Network similarity:** How similar are two (sub)networks;

## Deep Learning for Graphs

**Idea:** Transform information at the neighbors and combine it:
- Transform "messages" hi from neighbors: Wihi
- Adding them up
