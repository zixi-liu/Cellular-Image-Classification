## Frequent Subgraph Mining with GNNs

Subgraphs are the building blocks of networks: they have the power to characterize and discriminate networks.

Def 1. Node-induced subgraph (focus on functional groups)

Def 2. Edge-induced subgraph (focus on edges representing logical relations)

**Graph Isomorphism**

**Network Motifs**

- Pattern: small (node-induced) subgraph
- Recurring: found many times, i.e., with high frequency
- Significant: more frequent than expected

**Subgraph Frequency**
- Graph-level subgraph frequency 
- Node-level subgraph frequency

**Defining Motif Significance**
- Subgraphs that occur in a real network much more often than in a random network have functional significance.
